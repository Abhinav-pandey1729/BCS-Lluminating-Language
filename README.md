# Lluminating-Language

Official Repository for the Summer Project Lluminating Language offered by BCS

**_Project Objective :_** To learn about the wonderful world of Natural language Processing(NLP) from ground up and finally building our own custom open-source RAG infused Chatbot (We may see finetuning as well).

## Week 0

To start with, just to jog your memory, here are some resources to brush up on your basics.

1. [Building a Neural Network from Scratch using only Numpy](https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU?si=YC76soxNfFfz_Hff)
2. [Neural Networks from Ground Up](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3&si=cImwdtU-u_5W3BFn)

## Week 1

The first week will be dedicated to understanding the basics of NLP and the tools that we will be using throughout the project.

Task : To build a sentiment analysis model using the IMDB dataset and trying and testing different models and techniques.
